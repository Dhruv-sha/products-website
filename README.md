PORT=5000



‚öôÔ∏è Running the Project Locally
1. Start the Backend Server
To run the backend server, use the following command:

npm run start

2. Start the Frontend (if applicable)
In the frontend directory, run:

npm run dev

3. Access the App
Once both the backend and frontend are running, you can access the app by visiting:

Backend (API): http://localhost:5000/api/products

Frontend: http://localhost:3000



üõ†Ô∏è Development Features
